    <h2>November 8th, 2021 - Assignment 3 Reflection</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Q: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</li>
    <p>The two main challenges of this assignment was simplifying accessing elements in the DOM, and conceptualizing the most efficient way to complete the requirements. This came down to patience, breaking everything down, and stepping through everything individually.</p>
    <li>Q: What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</li>
    <p>I learned a ton about the general flow of JavaScript programs, along with how removing/adding/manipulating elements into the DOM work. I already knew the concepts, but implementing everything was really educational</p>
    <li>Q: What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</li>
    <p>The two most helpful resources were the code we wrote in class, CampusWire, and Google. Everytime I ran into a roadblock I would reference these resources and typically found an answer in a timely manner.</p>
    <li>Q: What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
    <p>Dictionaries in JavaScript, why my function was running without being called.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>October 23rd, 2021 - Assignment 2 Reflection</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Q: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</li>
    <p>There were definitely challenges and roadblocks during this assignment. These included everything from needing more familiarization with certain concepts, needing to look up syntax, and overall become more familiar with my development environment. For all of these, time, patience, and breaking down the problem (along with excessive Googling) helped a lot.</p>
    <li>Q: What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</li>
    <p>I realized I knew very little about implementing flex boxes, and feel like I learned an absolute ton about how they work. I also feel a lot more confident in my knowledge on basic CSS positioning, media queries and pseudoclasses.
    </p>
    <li>Q: What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</li>
    <p>There was one great CSS flex boxes resource I used, other than that I used the lecture notes and Stack Overflow, and Hess' office hours.</p>
    <li>Q: What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</li>
    <p>How flex boxes work (also referenced lecture notes for this) and how the fas fa plus class works (to change the plus color).</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>September 18th, 2021 - Assignment 1 Reflection</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Q: What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you work through them?</li>
    <p>It definitely took a bit to set up my development environment after not using HTML for a while. Making sure
    I was structuring my page in an effective way was also something I had to pay close attention to.</p>
    <li>Q: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
    <p>I already knew the basics of HTML page structures and tags. I learned that PyCharm has great HTML compatibility.
    </p>
    <li>Q: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing
        this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
    <p>The only thing I really used was the lecture notes! These were great for referencing tags, etc.</p>
    </ol>
