    <ol>
    <li>Q: What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment? How did you work through them?</li>
    <p>It definitely took a bit to set up my development environment after not using HTML for a while. Making sure
    I was structuring my page in an effective way was also something I had to pay close attention to.</p>
    <li>Q: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
    <p>I already knew the basics of HTML page structures and tags. I learned that PyCharm has great HTML compatibility.
    </p>
    <li>Q: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing
        this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
    <p>The only thing I really used was the lecture notes! These were great for referencing tags, etc.</p>
    </ol>
