    <ol>
    <li>Q: What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</li>
    <p>There were definitely challenges and roadblocks during this assignment. These included everything from needing more familiarization with certain concepts, needing to look up syntax, and overall become more familiar with my development environment. For all of these, time, patience, and breaking down the problem (along with excessive Googling) helped a lot.</p>
    <li>Q: What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</li>
    <p>I already knew the basics of HTML page structures and tags. I learned that PyCharm has great HTML compatibility.
    </p>
    <li>Q: What resources (e.g. specific web articles, the class Piazza forum, the TAs) were most helpful in completing
        this assignment? How did you use these resources?</li>
    <p>The only thing I really used was the lecture notes! These were great for referencing tags, etc.</p>
